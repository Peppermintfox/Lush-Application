      <p data-aos="fade-up" class="lead">I have always loved working for you –
        a company with ethics and products I believe in. However, I have two
        other loves. They took me to the edge of Cornwall to study illustration
        and then off around the world. I re-joined the Portsmouth team but have
        always wanted an opportunity to combine the passion I have for art, travel
        and natural products. When I saw the advert for a visual
        merchandiser to bring the Lush brand to Dubai, I knew this was my
        opportunity to shine. And so, with a little Lush calligraphy of my own,
        this is my story…

      <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Becoming an Illustrator</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        From the Cornish countryside of Falmouth University I earned
        my BA(hons) in Illustration. I worked with a variety of topics, materials
        and deadlines from 2 months to 24 hours. Discipline came from setting
        self-initiated ventures and illustrating everything from informative
        projects, children’s books, adult fiction and advertising campaigns.
        By experimenting and being open to new techniques I became very
        versatile and adapt easily to suit any project.
      </p>
      <h2 data-aos="fade-up"  class="h2 key-event">Managing Creative Champions</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        I curated a fundraiser for a group of illustrators to
        publish their work. The show was called
        <a href="http://www.falphabet.tumblr.com">Falphabet</a>. Gathering a team of 26
        artists, I assigned briefs, deadlines and artwork specifications. By
        directing the group effectively and negotiating terms for an exhibition
        with a local shop owner, I was able to bring the vision to life. The show
        was a success. And it gave me invaluable experience leading a
        team of talented people.

      <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Setting Out</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Seeking new adventures, I set off in 2015 to
        explore Asia. I visited Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and finally
        headed to Australia for a while. I am an incredibly organised person, so
        budgeting and arranging flights, accommodation and excursions came naturally
        to me. But I also learnt to adapt and balance this with spontaneity. Traveling
        gave me independence and helped me prove to myself I was capable of
        dealing calmly with new and unknown situations.
      </p>
      <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Settling In</h2>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Respecting local culture is hugely important to me. I make an effort to
        research a place and learn some of the language and key phrases as part
        of my travel preparation; even if I have to print them on a piece of
        paper and gently explain <i>pork is not a vegetarian substitute</i>.
        That's just one of the things that helps me to settle easily into any
        new country I visit.

    <h2 data-aos="fade-up">A Workplace To Be Proud Of</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      My career at Lush began as a Christmas Temp in 2012. I loved my job and
      came back to the Portsmouth store in 2016 after my travels. My colleagues
      are like family to me and I am proud to work for a company making the world
      a better place. I can’t sell what I don’t believe in and our practices and
      charitable work are some of my favourite things about the company.
    </p>
    <h2 data-aos="fade-up" class="h2 key-event">Learning The Brand</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">
      Portsmouth is a brilliant store with strong visual merchandising. My
      manager and his team communicate a clear vision and have taught me about
      the brand, company standards and how to tackle those tricky gift walls!
      I’ve already learnt a great deal from training sessions, assisting on
      merchandising nights and new window displays. As a creative person
      I can put my natural eye for detail, colour and composition into these
      areas and am keen to continue developing in this field.

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        I know how rare it is to find an opportunity like this. I hope that my
        story explains why this role is my cup of tea and shows you a real life
        example of how I can think outside the box and go the extra mile to
        deliver branded projects within a tight deadline.

      <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Connecting The Dots</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up">In summary, I shared these chapters with you to demonstrate three things:</p>

          <li data-aos="fade-up">
            <p>
              I know &mdash; from my studies and experience &mdash; the power
              and practise of visual communication and can manage team-based
              creative projects effectively.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li data-aos="fade-up">
            <p>
              I understand first-hand what it means to live in new countries and
              adapt quickly to different cultures.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li data-aos="fade-up">
            <p>
              I care about the company and connect personally with the brand.
              With a little investment, I know I have the potential to do great
              work.
